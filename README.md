To start the program, type "make" to compile server, client, DieWithError, and HandleTCPClient

Type "./server" into one terminal without the quotations to start the server program
Type "./client" into another terminal without the quotations to start the client side

On the client side you will be prompted to type the name of a file you want to request
Since client and server side will be the exact same the file getting copied will likely just be overwritten then replaced with
essentially the exact same file

After you are done, type "make clean" to remove the object files and executables
